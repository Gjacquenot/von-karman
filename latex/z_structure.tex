 

*intro*
Karmann vortex streets and what that is 

*theory*
- maybe theoretical things about the equations 
- ⁠numerical scheme and set up
- ⁠proof of convergence etc (numerical methods math stuff) 

*results* 
- ⁠fundamental problem cylinder, observe vortexes first analyses influence of reynoldsnumber etc.
- ⁠complex aerodynamics beyond cylinder influence of shape (wing shapes maybe 2 for high and low reynolds or what ever we find. Maybe it is enough just to compare on wingshape to the cylinder if we find nothing) 

*conclusion*
