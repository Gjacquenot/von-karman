\subsection{Benchmarking our solver}
%Show that the solver is working (so no object, reproduce pouiseville flow e.g. and compare to analytical solution.)
\subsection{Observing Karman vortex street}
% Show that we observe the phenomon describe time evolution, how can we see that the periodic state is achieved etc.  What are our needs for dt, dx etc.
\subsection{Influence of Reynolds number}
% Analysis how high low reynoldsnumber influence the flow and the phenomenon Maybe there is a limit for our solver or there is a limit for the phenomenon 
\subsection{Influence of the object}
%Vary the object size (diameter of the circle) add a ellipse into the flow Find analogy to construction of wings
